                                <p class=lead>The content is organized in sections that cover different aspects of the framework. Simply click on the title of the section (and subsections) to see the content. The two first sections deal with how to set up a project in React. Please note that this guide was  written for developers who have prior experience with HTML, CSS, JavasSript, and know how to use a terminal.  Some content originates from other webpages and was adapted here. I hope that you will find the page useful.

                                <p>Yep, that's right. I have been told that you can develop a React app without having to re-compile it every time you change your app. Isn't it nice? If you don't care about the hassle of re-compiling all the time, follow the instruction in the next section of this page.</p>
                            <p>To get that wonderful setup going, you need indeed <code>npm</code>. You will <b>install create-react-app</b> by executing the following command (only necessary the first time you use this tool):</p>
<pre>
sudo npm install -g create-react-app
</pre>
                                <p>After that, browse in your terminal to the parent of the folder where you want to <b>install your app</b> and execute this command:</p>
<pre>
create-react-app <i>my-app</i>
</pre>
                                <p>Where <code><i>my-app</i></code> is the name of the folder where you want to install your React setup.</p>
                                <p>From here, <code>cd</code> to the folder that was created for your app and type the following command:</p>
<pre>
npm start
</pre>
                                <p><b>This starts a server at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code></b> (a new tab pointing to this URL will open in your browser). The server is configured so that it compiles your code and reloads the page on the fly. <b>You can kill the server instantly by simultaneously pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.</b> If you want to keep the server running, you should instead run the following command (however, you will lose control of over the process):</p>
<pre>
npm start &amp; disown
</pre>
                                <p>If you chose the later solution, you can actually find and kill the server by finding its process ID, but that might take a little extra effort (using commands like <code>ps ax | grep "react"</code> and <code>kill</code>).</p>
                                <p>You're all set, now. <b>Write your project in the <code>/src</code>  folder of your app.</b></p>
                                <p>When you are ready to build your app for release, type in the following command:</p>
<pre>
npm run build
</pre>
                                <p>It will create a <code>/build</code> folder in your app with the appropriate compiled files. <b>Your build is totally portable, which means that you can be move the folder any where you would like</b> and it will render your app without any dependency.</p>
                                <p>Note that <b>your app is also portable</b>. Since the modules are contained in the app folder, you can move your app anywhere you like without breaking dependencies. Note that if you do that, you will have to restart the server.</p>

                            </div>

                                <p>To start a project in React, you need to do some setup. <code>npm</code> is the tool you want to use (make sure it is installed on your machine).</p>
                                <p>Open a terminal and <code>cd</code> to the folder of your project (use <code>mkdir</code> if necessary). Enter the three following commands:</p>
<pre>
npm init;
npm install --save react react-dom;
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react;
</pre>
                                <p>The first command creates the appropriate <code>package.json</code> file. You will be prompted input to describe your project, but you can just leave the fields blank for now, since you're going to copy/paste your own template later.</p>

                                <p>The two other commands install the latest version of the dependencies you are going to use for your React project (i.e., <b>react</b>, <b>webpack</b>, and <b>babel</b>) in a <code>node_modules</code> folder. These changes will be automatically reflected in <code>package.json</code>. Executing these commands might take a little while, depending on your internet connection.</p>
                                
                                <p>Create a <code>.babelrc</code> file at the root of your project with the following code in it:</p>
<pre>
// .babelrc file
{
  "presets": [
    "react"
  ]
}
</pre>
                                <p>Now, you need to create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file at the root of your project folder to configure Webpack.</p>
<pre>
// webpack.config.js
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
var HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
  template: __dirname + '/app/index.html',
  filename: 'index.html',
  inject: 'body'
});

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    './app/index.js'
  ],
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: "index_bundle.js"
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: "babel-loader"}
    ]
  },
  plugins: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]
};

</pre>
                                <p><b>At this point, your project is up and running.</b></p>
                                <p>This configuration of Webpack means that the source code of your project is contained in two files in the <code>app</code> folder: <code>index.html</code> and <code>index.js</code>. This is where you will write your code (aka <i>source code</i>). Make sure that you create these files.</p>
                                <p>Once you started writing your project, <b>the source code needs to be compiled</b> using the <code>npm</code> production command:</p>
<pre>
npm run production
</pre>
                                <p>Given the Webpack configuration, this command outputs the compiled code to the <code>dist</code> folder in two files: <code>index.html</code> and <code>index_bundle.js</code>.</p>
                                <p><b>The content of the <code>dist</code> folder can be copy/pasted anywhere and will work on its own.</b> Feel free to modify the Webpack configuration file to suit your project needs (output in a different directory, load other modules, change file input, etc.).</p>
                                <p>You can then (and not before) modify <code>package.json</code> with the following template:</p>
<pre>
// package.json file
{
  "name": "",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server",
    "production": "webpack -p"
  },
  "author": "Yves Gurcan &lt;gurcan.yves@gmail.com&gt; (http://yvesgurcan.com)",
  "license": "ISC",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "http://github.com/gerkhin/"
  },
}
</pre>
                                <p>Be careful when you modify <code>package.json</code>: keep the dependency sections (not visible here, since the output will depend on the version of the dependencies, which change over time) in the file to make it easier for other people to install your project.</p>
                                <p>To update the app, <b>you have to run the following command every time you want to reflect any change on the code</b> (in short: this command rebuilds the output from the source code):</p>
<pre>
npm run production
</pre>
                                <p>That's it!</p>

                                </div>
                                <div id=elements class=content>
                                    <p>Simply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, <b>a React element is an object representation of a DOM node</b>. It’s important to note that a React element isn’t actually the thing you’ll see on your screen, instead, it’s just an object representation of it. In order to create our object representation of a DOM node (aka React element), we can use React’s <code>createElement</code> method.</p>
<pre>
// the createElement method
const element = React.createElement(
    'div',
    {id: 'login-btn'},
    'Login'
)
</pre>
                                    <p><code>createElement</code> takes in <b>three arguments</b>. The first is a tag name string (<code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, etc), the second is any attributes you want the element to have, the third is contents or the children of the element, in this case the text <code>Login</code>.</p>
                                    <p>The <code>createElement</code> invocation above is going to return an object with this shape</p>
<pre>
// the object returned by the createElement method
{
    type: 'div',
    props: {
        children: 'Login',
        id: 'login-btn'
    }
}
</pre>
                                    <p>and when it’s rendered to the DOM (using <code>ReactDOM.render</code>), we’ll have a new DOM node that looks like this</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- the HTML representation of the element --&gt;
&lt;div id='login-btn'&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
                                </div>
                                <div id=components class=title>
                                    <h3>Components</h3>
                                </div>
                                <div id=components class=content>
                                    <p>What’s interesting about learning React is that typically the first thing you’re taught is components. <b>A component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element</b>.</p>
<pre>
// a React component
function Button ({ onLogin }) {
    return React.createElement(
        'div',
        {id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin},
        'Login'
    )
}
</pre>
                                    <p>Above, we have a <code>Button</code> component which accepts an <code>onLogin</code> input and returns a React element. One thing to note is that <b>our Button component receives an <code>onLogin</code> method as its prop. To pass that along to our object representation of the DOM, we pass it along as the second argument to <code>createElement</code></b>, just as we did our <code>id</code> attribute.</p>
                                    <p><b>You can also pass in other React components</b> to the first argument of <code>createElement</code>.</p>
<pre>
// an element can reference another element
const element = React.createElement(
    User,
    {name: 'Tyler McGinnis'},
    null
)
</pre>
                                </div>
                                <div id=breakdown-components class=title>
                                    <h3>How to break down components</h3>

                                <div id=breakdown-components class=content>
                                    <p>How do you know what should be its own component? Just use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, <b>a component should ideally only do one thing</b>. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div id=state-vs-props class=content>
                            <p>There are two types of "model" data in React: props and state. <b>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.</b> props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the concept of state, don't use state at all to build this static version. <b>State is reserved only for interactivity</b>, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don't need it.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- state -->
                    <div id=state class=wrapper>
                        <div id=state class=title>
                            <h2>State</h2>
                        </div>
                        <div id=state class=content>
                            <div id=what-is-a-state class=title>
                                <h3>What is a state?</h3>
                            </div>
                            <div id=what-is-a-state class=content>
                                <p>Say that you want to build a ticking clock app. The <code>Clock</code> component will set up its own timer and update itself every second. To implement this, we need to add "state" to the component. <b>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.</b> Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local state is exactly that: a feature available only to classes.</p>
                                <p>You can convert a functional component like <code>Clock</code> to a class in five steps:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Create an ES6 class with the same name that extends <code>React.Component</code>.</li>
                                        <li>Add a single empty method to it called <code>render()</code>.</li>
                                        <li>Move the body of the function into the <code>render()</code> method.</li>
                                        <li>Replace <code>props</code> with <code>this.props</code> in the <code>render()</code> body.</li>
                                        <li>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</li>
                                    </ol>
<pre>
// a component as a class rather than a function
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
</pre>

                                <p>A component based architecture naturally makes sharing state more difficult. If two components rely on the same state, where should that state live? This was such a popular question that it spurred an entire ecosystem of solutions which eventually ended with Redux. Redux’s solution is to put that shared state in another location called a “store”. React’s solution is to find the nearest parent of both of those components and have that  <b>parent manage the shared state, passing it down to the child components as needed</b>. There are pros and cons to both approaches but it’s important to be aware that both solutions exist.</p>

                                <p>One of the best parts of React is that you can use the same intuition that you have about JavaScript functions for when and where you should create React components. However, instead of your function taking in some arguments and returning a value, your function is going to take in some arguments and return an object representation of your UI. This idea can be summed up in the following formula, fn(d) = V. <b>A Function takes in some Data and returns a View</b>. This is a beautiful way to think about developing user interfaces because now your UI is just composed of different function invocations. This is how you’re already used to building applications and now you can take advantage of all of the benefits of function composition when building UIs.</p>

                                <p>What’s great about React is you don’t <i>have</i> to return typical “views” from your components. <b>As long as what eventually gets returned is a React element, <code>null</code>, or <code>false</code>, you’re good.</b></p>

                        </div>
                        <div id=keys class=content>
                            <p>When you render a list of items, React always stores some info about each item in the list. <b>If you render a component that has state, that state needs to be stored</b> – and regardless of how you implement your components, React stores a reference to the backing native views.</p>
                            <p>When you update that list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could've added, removed, rearranged, or updated items in the list.</p>
                            <p>Imagine transitioning from</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- initial list --&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Alexa: 7 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben: 5 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
                            <p>to</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- altered list --&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Ben: 9 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claudia: 8 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexa: 5 tasks left&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>
                            <p>React is just a computer program and doesn't know what you intended it to do. As a result, <b>React asks you to specify a key property on each element in a list, a string to differentiate each component from its siblings</b>. In this case, <code>alexa</code>, <code>ben</code>, <code>claudia</code> might be sensible keys; if the items correspond to objects in a database, the database ID is usually a good choice:</p>
<pre>
// how to specify a key on an element
&lt;li key={user.id}>{user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left</li>
</pre>
                            <p><code>key</code> is a special property that's reserved by React. When an element is created, React pulls off the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though it may look like it is part of props, <b>it cannot be referenced with <code>this.props.key</code>.</b> React uses the key automatically while deciding which children to update; there is no way for a component to inquire about its own key.</p>
                            <p>When a list is rerendered, React takes each element in the new version and looks for one with a matching key in the previous list. When a key is added to the set, a component is created; when a key is removed, a component is destroyed. Keys tell React about the identity of each component, so that it can maintain the state across rerenders. If you change the key of a component, it will be completely destroyed and recreated with a new state.</p>
                            <p>If you don't specify any key, React will warn you and fall back to using the array index as a key – which is not the correct choice if you ever reorder elements in the list or add/remove items anywhere but the bottom of the list. Explicitly passing <code>key={i}</code> silences the warning but has the same problem so isn't recommended in most cases.</p>
                            <p><b>Component keys don't need to be globally unique, only unique relative to the immediate siblings.</b></p>

                                    <p>The variables <code>first</code>, <code>second</code>, and <code>third</code> were assigned the value of the N<sup>th</sup> element in the array.</p>
                                    <p>Here is how to <b>destructure an object</b>:</p>
<pre>

}

// destructuring of the object
<b>const {name, sport, location} = athlete;</b>

console.log(name) // Alex

                                <p>To give the variable a name that differs from the key, <b>use <code>key:var</code></b> instead:</p>
